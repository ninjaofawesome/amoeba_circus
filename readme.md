Amoeba Circus will be one of my first complex rails applications.  Most likely, it will be an ongoing project.

Here's How It works:

1. The ringmaster is responsible for creating and destroying the amoebas as well as creating events for the amoebas to perform in.

2. Each amoeba can only live for one generation.  When the amoeba splits, it has two descendants that will inherit the talents that the parent once had.

3. Each amoeba has three talents out of 5 choices (acrobatics, contortionist, juggler, clown and freak).  A primary talent, a secondary talent and an "if all else fails" talent.

4. There are three types of events (entertainment, freakshow and acrobatics).  Each event has a minimum number of performers and a maximum number, a date, a time and a name.

That is the MVP.  The goal will be that the ringmaster will create amoebas and events and also will divide the amoebas as they see fit.  The amoebas will recieve a schedule of when they are supposed to perform.
